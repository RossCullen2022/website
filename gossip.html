<h2>Update on Salahs contract</h2>
<img src="img/MoContract.jpg">
<p>Jurgen Kloop has revealed that his new contract might be a 'key' factor in convincing Mohamed Salah to sign a new contract at Anfield.

The forward's contract expires next summer, and there are reports that he may be on his way out of Anfield. The Reds would, of course, be reluctant to lose the Egyptian, given his outstanding form this season.

Salah was named Football Writers' Association Football of the Year after scoring 30 goals in all competitions this season. With 22 goals this season, he is far and by the Premier League's leading scorer, with closest rivals Son Heung-Min and Cristiano Ronaldo each having only 17 to their names.</p>
